<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The minishell project is a common programming exercise often assigned in computer science courses and coding bootcamps. It focuses on building a simplified Unix shell, which is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by entering and executing commands.

Project Goals:
The primary goals of the minishell project include:

Command Execution: Implementing the ability to interpret and execute basic shell commands entered by the user.

I/O Redirection: Handling input and output redirection, which allows users to redirect command input from files or redirect output to files.

Pipeline Support: Enabling the execution of command pipelines, where the output of one command serves as the input to another.

Built-in Commands: Implementing a set of built-in shell commands (e.g., cd, echo, exit) that are executed within the shell process itself, rather than launching separate processes.

Signal Handling: Managing and responding to signals such as Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP) to control the behavior of the shell and its running processes.

Environment Variables: Supporting environment variables, allowing users to set, unset, and modify them.

Prompt Display: Displaying a command prompt indicating that the shell is ready to accept user input.

Project Workflow:
The development process for the minishell project typically involves the following steps:

Parsing: Parse the user input to separate commands, arguments, and any special symbols for redirection or pipelines.

Command Execution: Execute the parsed commands by either launching external processes using functions like fork() and exec(), or by handling built-in commands internally.

I/O Redirection: Implement redirection of standard input and output based on user-specified symbols (<, >, >>).

Pipelines: Enable command pipelines by connecting the standard output of one command to the standard input of another.

Signal Handling: Implement signal handlers to catch and respond to signals like SIGINT and SIGTSTP.

Built-in Commands: Implement the behavior of built-in commands within the shell process.

Environment Variables: Manage environment variables and allow users to interact with them.

Prompt: Display a user-friendly prompt to indicate that the shell is ready to receive commands.
